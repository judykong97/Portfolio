description: In this project, my teammates and I designed a mobile app for the local non-profit warehouse Construction Junction. Through preliminary research and after identifying values and needs, utilizing multiple interactions design techniques to help with our brainstorming, we came up with a smart furniture retail app using augmented reality.

### Background

Construction Junction is a large, non-profit warehouse in Pittsburgh, PA supplying surplus construction materials & appliances at reduced prices. Our goal for this project was to design a mobile app for Construction Junction utilizing unique features of smartphones such as camera and sensing. 

### Research

We found that Construction Junction was listed as one of only three reuse/recycle centers in Western PA. Thus, we learned that our app did not need to introduce a competitive edge to the business, but could focus on enhancing and promoting its core values of sustainability and education. This would become a key component of our long-term road map moving forward.

Our preliminary research also looked at who was involved with Construction Junction and how these different groups interacted with each other. We isolated employees/volunteers, customers/donors, and community/environmental groups. We noted that the primary thing these groups all had in common was the mission of promoting reusability of products and sustainability, and this helped guide the general theme of our design and our overall idea of forming a community around Construction Junction.

### Ideation

#### Establishing Value Flows

Using the research we collected about Construction Junction, we began to investigate the interactions between different users and stakeholders to isolate opportunities for our intervention by creating value flow diagrams. We noticed that there are various different ways users can interact with the company (as donors, buyers, volunteers) and started to focus in on how we could improve users’ interactions with Construction Junction.

#### Challenging Assumptions

We started looking at what assumptions might exist around construction material shopping, and explored possible interventions our app could make by breaking these assumptions to improve the user experience. One important assumption we identified was that customers had to view the products in person to get an accurate idea of how they might fit into their space, which would become key to our proposed app.

### Narrowing Problem Space

Based off our ideation process, our team isolated a huge opportunity in addressing how user’s browse for products online, and decided to approach the problem starting first with space and style constraints. This way, we can maximize the utility of the tool for users by filtering options by what can actually fit in their rooms and what will fit their style, rather than showing users the entire catalog.

### Iteration and Refinements

To visualize how a CJ buyer would use our app, we each drew a complete flow of the app from creating a project to the wishlist. We focused on two native app features: the AR measuring tool and horizontal swipe to browse. Interestingly, we each had different visual style and emphasis in our low-fi prototype. We then chose screens from each design and combined them to become our final low-fi prototype.

From the low-fi prototype sketches, we narrowed down to 5 screens that highlight the flow of our app. Then we digitized the wireframe sketches and determined the details of the in-between steps. The process of digitizing our sketches helped us identify details we did not consider before. Because our app show inventory results based on user input, we realized a logical sequence is crucial to creating a smooth user experience and to generating useful, insightful data.

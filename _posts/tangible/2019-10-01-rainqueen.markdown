description: In this project, we designed and prototyped a heat-sensitive drag queen camping technology with morphing materials. With both advocacy of inclusion and consideration for practical use in our design, we made a prototype of Rain Queen, which transforms from a regular cloth shape into a more dramatic look when the environment temperature increated. 
story: This project is the final project for the course 05-899 Morphing Materials From Programmable to Learning Matter, taught by <a href="https://morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/lining-yao/">Prof. Lining Yao</a>.

### Background

We got our inspiration from the drag queen persona Pattie Gonia [@pattiegonia](https://instagram.com/pattiegonia?igshid=nzkte9iy8eok) on Instagram, played by artist and photographer Wyn Wiley [@wynwileyphoto](https://instagram.com/wynwileyphoto?igshid=1gtrd2exihhmf). While most queer communities nowadays are concentrated in big cities, Pattie Gonia brings drags and advocacy from cities to outdoors and in the wild.

### Introduction

When the environment temperature increases, a simple tendon structure turns this poncho dress into a more dramatically regal structure. The pulley system is reactive to a mechanical circuit, driven by our heat-responsive linear and bending actuators.

This rain queen design is not just a drag queen camping technology, but also an act of placing LGBTQ+ groups at the center of design through compassionate attention.  

### Water Collection

In addition to the drag queen camping idea, we also hoped to add some practical camping functionalities to this design - water collection. As the shape transformation is triggered, the morphing system changes from a dormant shirtâ€™s shape to a regal water collecting vessel.

### Morphing Mechanism

We hoped the drag queen "second skin" to have automatic shape transformation in response to the surrounding environment, thus we designed two types of morphing mechanisms responsive to temerature change - a linear actuator and a bending actuator. 

The idea behind both actuators is that the state of the actuator is dependent on the amount of air in it. The the actuator is heated with the increas of temperature in the surrounding environment, the liquid sealed inside the actuator becomes vapor, thus increasing the amount of air inside of it, triggering the shape change of the actuator.

The **bending actuator** has a small air bag on each of the hinges, and each air bag contains a small amount of Novec 7100, an alcohol-similar liquid with a very low boiling temperature. When heated, the air bags are "blown up", thus triggering the bending of the actuator.

Under the similar idea but with a different geometry, the **linear actuator** shrinks in length when more air is contained in the actuator.

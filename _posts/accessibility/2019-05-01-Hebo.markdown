description: In this project, my teammates and I conducted extensive user research at the UPMC Falk clinic with patients after Mohr's Surgery, among which were mostly older adults. By understanding users' needs during the post-operative care process and in older adults using technologies in general, we came up with the design of a mobile post-operative care asssistant, Hebo 2.0.

description: In this project, my teammates and I conducted extensive user research at the UPMC Falk clinic with patients after Mohr's Surgery, among which were mostly older adults. By understanding users' needs during the post-operative care process and in older adults using technologies in general, we came up with the design of a mobile post-operative care asssistant, Hebo 2.0.

### Background

After a patient undergoes Mohs surgery, they typically have questions and concerns about their postoperative treatment. Before and after surgery they are given explicit instructions on how to care for themselves and also provided with an instruction sheet to take home with them. Unfortunately, many patients struggle to remember and to interpret the basic instructions that are provided to them. Therefore, patients require support from clinical staff over the phone or in the clinic to address common concerns. Moreover, staff members often have to dedicate significant portions of time to communicate information already provided to the patients. 

### Stakeholders

We created a stakeholder map dividing our stakeholders into several parties, based on their interactions with patients in post-operative care. The surgeon who carries out the surgery; UPMC staff who help patients change dressing, call patients for check-up and answer questions; patients’ immediate family, extended family, and friends and community who might take care of them during the post-operative process.

### User Research

We did job shadowing and conducted interviews with both clinic staff and patients to better understand their needs and existing challenges in the process. To better understand their feelings, we included activities such as card sorting in our interview process.

We then came up with a journey map for nurses and patients, which helped us better understand the goals and needs of these stakeholders. We looked at the surgery procedure by the six phases: diagnosis, pre-surgery, during surgery, right after surgery, 48-hour post-surgery, one-week check-up and later. For each phase, we discussed patients’ emotions and thoughts, their tasks and touchpoints, in order to better understand each part of the surgery process and discover opportunities. Based on that, we used sticky notes to discover existing pain points in different phases of surgery, especially the post surgery phases.

To better understand patients' experiences during post-operative care at home, specifically during the dressing change process, we did further empirical research and tried to change wound dressing for ourselves like patients after the Mohr's surgery.

### Takeaways from User Research

We summarized our takeaways from user research into the following key insights: 

- Patients need more help when they start with hands-on post-operative care on their own. 

- Patients need to be assured that what they are doing / feeling is normal. 

- Patients' feelings and emotions affect their post-op decisions.

- Patients want personalized care. 

- Visual representations and written out text are important for post-operative care for the predominant demographic of skin cancer patients. 

- Some patients hesitate to seek for help from family/staff due to personal reasons. (e.g. being too independent, not wanting to burden family, thinking they are probably fine)

- Patients want immediate response to their questions while clinic staff don’t want their workflow to be interrupted. 

- Patients require simpler ways to find post-operative care dos and don’ts.

### Iterations & Refinements

To test out our mid-fi prototype and improve the design, our team conducted three rounds of user testing in the UPMC Falk clinic. We tested the prototype with various different potential user groups of the assistant, including clinic staff (residential doctors, physician assistants, and nurses) as well as patients. During user testing, we set different scenarios for our users, including being discharged from the clinic, changing dressing at home for the first time, concerned about bleeding, and feeling pain.

Overall, we received very positive feedback during the three rounds of user testing in the clinic. Except for feedbacks on the design of the assistant, we’ve also put a lot of focus on the accuracy of medical terms and processes to ensure that the assistant gives correct instructions and suggestions, and received valuable feedback during user testing.

Based the feedback we received during user testing, our refinements mainly focused on:

- Improving usability and accessibility of the app

- Adding more feedforward and feedback to make the app more intuitive

- Adding conversational features to allow hands-free interactions

- Changing certain wordings to make sure medical terms and demonstrations are accurate

- Having detailed stepwise breakdown of processes to guide users step by step, with explanations on each step

- Establishing trust by giving encouraging feedback to users

- Making action terms clearer and adding more error prevention features

### User Testing Quotes

##### *"Pretty straightforward. Easy to follow."*
##### *"I really like the pictures in dressing change tutorial."*
##### *"It’s good that the App is simple, especially for elderly users."*
##### *"The instructions are succinct."*

### Motivation

Blind people frequently encounter inaccessible dynamic touchscreens in their everyday lives that are difficult, frustrating, and often impossible to use independently. Touchscreens are often the only way to control everything from coffee machines and payment terminals, to subway ticket machines and in-flight entertainment systems.

We identified two major challenges in using dynamic touchscreen interfaces for visually-impaired users: 

- As the visual user interfaces change, interactions often occur over multiple different screens, and it's always hard for users to label certain parts of the interface using traditional methods. 

- It is easy to accidentally trigger interface actions while exploring the screen.
